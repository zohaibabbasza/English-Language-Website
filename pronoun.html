	<center><h1>Pronoun</h1></center><br>
	<p>
		A pronoun is a part of a speech which functions as a replacement for a noun. Some examples of pronouns are:
		I, it, he, she, mine, his, hers, we, they, theirs, and ours.<br><br>

		Sample Sentences:<br>
		Janice is a very stubborn child. She just stared at me and when I told her to stop.<br>
		The largest slice is mine.<br>
		We are number one.<br><br>
		
		<b>Kinds of Pronouns</b><br>
		There are six kinds of pronouns with different functions:<br><br>

		<b>1. Personal pronouns</b><br>

		This kind of pronoun refers to a particular person or thing. The form of the personal pronoun that is 
		appropriate to use for a specific sentence depends on the gender and number of persons or things that 
		serve as the antecedents.<br><br>

		For example, you are referring to a female subject in the sentence, the pronouns that are appropriate 
		to use are: she, her, and hers. If you are referring to a male, you can use: he, him, and his. For a
		group of persons, not including yourself, the appropriate pronouns are: they, them, and theirs.<br><br>

		Personal pronouns can serve as the subjects, objects of the verb or preposition, and can also show 
		possession. They are formally classified into: subjective personal pronouns, objective personal pronouns, 
		and possessive personal pronouns.<br><br>

		<b>Examples:</b><br>

		You are definitely the biggest science nerd I’ve ever met.<br>
		In the example above, the underlined pronoun serves as the subject.<br>
		Harry persuaded her to come with him.<br>
		The pronoun “her” is the object of the verb persuaded. Him, on the other hand, is the object
		of the preposition with.<br>
		Ours is the one on the left.<br><br>
		The pronoun “ours” signifies possession.<br><br>
		
		<b>2. Demonstrative pronouns</b><br>

		The function of this kind of pronoun is to point to a noun. Examples are: this, these, that,
		and those. The pronouns “this” and “these” points to things that are nearby while the other two are for 
		things that are far. Aside from proximity, you must also consider the number of things you are pointing out. 
		For singular nouns, “this” and “that” should be used, while for plural nouns “these” and “those” are appropriate.<br><br>

		<b>Examples:</b><br>

		That is the car that I’ll buy for my birthday.<br>
		The speaker is pointing out to a singular noun that is far from him/her.<br>
		She said she wanted these.<br><br>
		
		<b>3. Indefinite pronouns</b><br>

		This kind of pronoun refers to unspecified things. Some examples are: any, all, another, each, anyone, 
		anything, anybody, nobody, everyone, everybody, someone, somebody, few, and many.<br><br>

		<b>Examples:</b><br>

		 Many were called for the interview but only 3 were hired.<br>
		He’s ready to give up everything for his family’s safety.<br><br>
		
		<b>4. Intensive pronouns</b><br>

		The function of intensive pronouns is to give emphasis to the antecedent. Examples of this kind of pronoun are:
		myself, itself, himself, herself, yourself, yourselves, themselves, and ourselves.<br><br>

		<b>Examples:</b><br>

		The president himself said that it was a terrorist attack.<br>
		I myself knew that it was a mistake.<br><br>
		
		<b>5. Interrogative pronouns</b><br>

		As the title implies, the function of this kind of pronoun is to ask questions. Examples of interrogative 
		pronouns are: who, what, which, whom, whoever, whatever, whichever, and whomever.<br><br>

		<b>Examples:</b><br>

		Who wrote the book 1984?<br>
		What did the doctors say?<br><br>
		
		<b>6. Relative pronouns</b><br>

		This kind of pronoun links one clause or phrase to another. Some of the most common relative pronouns are: who,
		whoever, whomever, that, and which.<br><br>

		<b>Examples:</b><br>

		The contestant who gets the highest score wins the million dollar jackpot.<br>
		In this sentence, the underlined pronoun is the subject of the verb gets. The subordinate clause, “who gets the 
		highest score wins the million dollar jackpot,” describes the noun contestant.<br>
		He will accept whichever project comes first.<br>
		The subordinate clause, ”whichever project comes first,” serves as the object of the verb “will accept.”<br><br>
		
		<b>7. Reflexive pronouns</b><br>

		This kind of pronoun is used to refer back to the subject. Some of the reflexive pronouns are: yourself, 
		myself, ourselves, himself, herself, themselves, and itself.<br><br>

		<b>Examples:</b><br>

		Sandra never forgets to send a copy of the email to herself.<br>
		The pronoun “herself” refers back to the subject of the sentence, which is Sandra.<br>
		He promised to repair the broken fence, however, we ended up fixing it ourselves.<br>
		The underlined reflexive pronoun refers back to the subject we.<br>
