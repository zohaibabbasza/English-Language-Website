	<h2>What is an Adverb ?</h2><br>
	<p>
		An adverb is a part of speech used to describe a verb, adjective, clause, or another adverb. It simply tells the readers how,
		where, when, or the degree at which something was done.<br><br>

		<b>Examples:</b><br><br>

		The manager accepted the challenge very nicely.<br>
		The italicized word is an adverb that describes nicely, which is another adverb.<br>

		Tears began to fall as he saw the completely lifeless body of his wife.<br>
		 

		The adverb in this sentence is completely, which describes the adjective lifeless.<br>

		 

		Surprisingly, the cubicles of the public restroom are clean.<br>
		 

		Surprisingly is the adverb in this sentence. It modifies the clause that comes right after it.<br>

		Even though all of the sample sentences above have one-word adverbs, adverbs are not limited to a single word. Sometimes, adverbs
		come in phrases. Take a look at the example below.

	<h2>Kinds Of Adverbs</h2><br>
	<p>
	Aside from answering the main question “What is an adverb?” it is also important to explore the different kinds of this part of speech.
	Basically,there are four kinds of adverbs:<br><br>
	
	<b>Adverbs of Manner</b><br>
	 

	This kind of adverb describes the manner by which something was done or something happened. Adverbs of manner answer the question “How?”<br><br>

	 

	<b>Examples:</b><br>

	 

	The students measured the volume of the chemicals accurately.<br>
	 

	The italicized adverb describes the verb “measured.”<br>

	 

	She walks gracefully.<br>
	 

	Gracefully modifies the verb “walks.”<br><br>

	 

	<b>Adverbs of Place</b><br>
	 

	Adverbs of place simply answer the question “Where?” Here are some examples:<br>

	 

	Heisenberg looked away from the dead body.<br>
	 

	The adverb away answers the question, “Where did Heisenberg look?”<br>

	 

	They built a huge toy factory nearby.<br>
	 

	The adverb nearby answers the question, “Where did they build the huge toy factory?”<br>

	You will notice based on these examples that adverbs of place can be placed right after the verb or after the object of the verb.<br><br>

	<b>Adverbs of Time</b><br>
	 

	Aside from answering when an event occurred, adverbs of time also answer questions like, “How long?” and “How often?”<br><br>

	 

	<b>Examples:</b><br>

	 

	Syndra lived in Germany for a year.<br>
	 

	For a year tells how long something happened (how long Syndra lived in Germany).<br>

	 

	I’m going to the dentist tomorrow.<br>
	The adverb tomorrow indicates when something will be done.<br><br>

	<b>Adverbs of Degree</b><br>
	 

	This kind of adverb indicates the degree at which something will be done. It tells something about the intensity.<br><br>

	 

	<b>Examples:</b><br>

	You didn’t try hard enough.<br>
	 

	Hard enough is an adverb pertaining to the verb, “try.”<br>

	 

	The temperature of the room was extremely<br>
