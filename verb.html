	<center><h1>Verb</h1></center>
	<h2>What is a verb?</h2>
	<p>
	A verb can be considered as one of the most important parts of a sentence. You probably already know that
	a sentence must be composed of a subject and a predicate, so what makes a verb so important? Well, the verb
	is the main component of a predicate. Without it, there won’t be a sentence, just a bunch of words with an 
	incomplete thought. Simply defined, the verb is a part of speech which is used to demonstrate an action or 
	a state of being.<br><br>
	</p>
	<h2>What are the Different Kinds of Verbs?</h2><br>
	<p>
		Your primary school teachers must have defined verb as an “action word.” That is right, however, verbs are 
		more than just words that express an action done physically like:<br>

		run, jump, dance, write, kick, etc.<br>

		In reality, verbs may also refer to an action done mentally such as:<br>

		think, ponder, guess, imagine, wonder, etc.<br><br>

		<b>1. Normal Verbs and Non-Continuous Verbs</b><br>

		The first type of verb used to express physical action is called  a Normal Verb, while the second one, which 
		refers to an action you can’t see someone do, is called a Non-Continuous Verb.<br><br>
		
		<b>Sample Sentences:</b><br>

		Jesse Pinkman laughed hysterically.
		The verb in this sentence is laughed and the subject who does the action is Jessie Pinkman.<br>
		 Aegon Targaryen and his sisters conquered the Seven Kingdoms.<br>
		The verb is conquered, while the subject in this sentence is Aegon Targaryen and his sisters.<br>
		Darth Vader thought of an evil plan to get rid of Darth Sidious.<br>
		Thought is the mental action word done by the subject Darth Vader in the sentence above.<br>
		I wonder what will happen on the next episode.<br>
		The pronoun, I, is the subject in the last sentence and the verb is wonder.<br><br>
		
		<b>2. Linking Verb</b><br>

		Aside from the Normal Verbs and Non-Continuous Verbs, there is another type which is called the Linking Verb.<br>

		As the name suggests, a linking verb is a kind of verb that links a subject to the complement. A complement 
		is the part of a sentence which modifies or provides more information about the subject. Examples of linking 
		verbs are:<br>

		am, is, was, are, were, has been, might have been, become, etc.<br>

		The words listed above are just some of the “true linking verbs.” They are called that way because 
		they have no other functions but to serve as linking verbs. However, just like some people,
		certain verbs also have dual personalities. Take a look at the two sentences below:<br><br>

		Irine tasted the exotic food.<br>
		The exotic food tasted great!<br>
		In the first sentence, you can easily say that the italicized word is an action word done by Irine.<br> 
		However, in the second sentence, the same word has a different function. It serves as a linking verb 
		that connects exotic food with the word, great.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>What are Multi-Part Verbs?</h2><br>
	<p>
		Do not assume that verbs are limited to a single word. Sometimes, they come in two to four words. The basic 
		formula for verbs with multiple parts is:<br>
		
		The auxiliary verbs, also called “helping verbs,” allow you to write in various verb tenses and voices when combined with a
		base or main verb.<br><br>

		Take a look at the examples below:<br>

		I was given a two-week notice by the sales agent.<br>
		The sentence above is written in the passive voice.  Was is the auxiliary verb and given is the main verb.<br>
		 It must have been raining very hard.<br>
		The main verb is raining and the auxiliary verbs are must have been.<br>
