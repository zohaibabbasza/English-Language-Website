	<center><h1>Present Tense</h1></center>
	<h2>Simple Present</h2>
	<p>
		It is used to express an action in present time, habitual or usual actions or daily event or universal fact.
		It is used to express an action in present time which is usually done on a regular basis. For example a student
		says, “I go to school”. It is a daily activity of a student to go to school, so such actions are expressed by present
		simple tense. Another example is, “I work in a factory”. It tells about a usual action of a person that he works in
		a factory on regular basis.<br>
		 
		Rules. 1st form of verb or base verb is used as main verb in sentence.<br><br>
		 
								 Structure of sentence – Rules<br><br>
		 
		Positive Sentence<br>
			 • Subject + Main verb + Object<br>
			 • Subject + 1st form of verb (or base verb) + Object<br>
		Note: If the subject in a sentence is “he, she, it, singular or proper noun” then “s” or “es” is added to the first<br>
		form of verb or base form in the sentence.<br><br>
		
		Examples. <br>
				 I write a letter. <br>
				 He gets up early in the morning.<br>
				 Sun rises in east.<br><br>
		 
		Negative Sentences<br>
		   • Subject + auxiliary verb +NOT + Main verb +object<br>

				 He does not get up early in the morning.<br>
				 Sun does not rise in east.<br><br>
		 
		Note: In negative sentence auxiliary verb “do or does” along with “not” is used. If the subject in a sentence is
		“he, she, it, singular or proper noun”, then “Does not” is used after subject in sentence. If subject is “I, we,
		they, you or plural” then “Do not” is used after subject in sentence. “s” or “es” is not added to main verb in 
		negative sentence<br><br>
		 
		Interrogative Sentence<br>
		   • Auxiliary verb + Subject + Main verb + Object<br>
		   • Do/Does + Subject + 1st for of verb (or base verb) + Object<br><br>
		
		Examples.<br>
				 Do I write a letter?<br>
				 Does he get up early in the morning?<br>
				 Does sun rise in east?	<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Present Continuous</h2>
	<p>
		It is used to express a continued or ongoing action at present time. It expresses an action which is in progress at 
		the time of speaking. For example, a person says, “I am writing a letter”. It means that he is in the process of writing
		a letter right now. Such actions which are happening at time of speaking are expressed by present continuous tense. Present
		Continuous tense is also called Present progressive tense.<br><br>

		Rules. Auxiliary verb “am or is or are” is used in sentence. 1st form of verb or base verb + ing (present participle)
		is used as main verb in sentence.<br><br>

											Structure of sentence<br><br>
		 
		Positive Sentence<br>
			• Subject + auxiliary verb + main verb-ing (Present participle) + object<br>
			• Subject + am/is/are + (1st form of verb or base verb + ing) + object<br>
		If the subject is “I” then auxiliary verb “am” is used after subject in sentence.<br>
		If the subject is “He, She, It, singular or proper name” then auxiliary verb “is” is used after subject in sentence.<br>
		If subject is “You, They or plural” then auxiliary verb “are” is used after subject in sentence.<br>
		The participle “ing” is added to the 1st form of verb i.e. going (go) writing (write)<br><br>

				I am playing cricket.<br>
				He is driving a car<br>
				They are reading their lessons.<br><br>
		 
		Negative Sentence<br>
			  • Subject + auxiliary verb + not + main verb-ing (Present participle) + object<br>
			  • Subject + am/is/are + not + (1st form of verb + ing) + object<br>
		Rules for using auxiliary verbs (am or is or are) after subject in negative sentences are same as mentioned above. <br><br>

		Examples.<br>

		Interrogative Sentences<br>

			  • Auxiliary verb + Subject + main verb-ing (Present participle) + object<br>
			  • Am/is/are + Subject + (1st form of verb or base verb + ing) + object<br>
		For making interrogative sentences, the sentence is started with auxiliary verb rather than putting auxiliary verb 
		inside the sentence. If the subject is “I” the sentence starts with auxiliary verb “am”. If the subject is “He, She,
		It, singular or proper name” the sentence starts with auxiliary verb “is”. If subject is “You, They or plural” the 
		sentence starts with auxiliary verb “are”.<br><br>
		
		Examples.<br>
				  Am I playing cricket?<br>
				  Is he driving a car?<br>
				 Are they reading their lessons?<br>
	</p>	
	<h2>Present Perfect</h2>
	<p>
		It is used to expressed an action which happened or completed in past but usually the action which happened or completed
		at a short time before now (near past) not a very long time before now. Specific time such as two years ago, last week or
		that day is usually not used in the sentences of in this tense. It means that this tense expresses the action whose time
		when it happened, is not exactly specified but it sounds to refer to some action that happened or completed in near past.<br><br>

		Rules: Auxiliary verb “has or have” is used in sentence. 3rd form of verb (past participle) is used as main verb in
		sentence.<br><br>
		 
										Structure of Sentence<br><br>
		Positive Sentence<br>
				 • Subject + Auxiliary verb + main verb (past participle) + Subject<br>
				 • Subject + has/have + 3rd form of verb or past participle + subject<br>
		If the subject is “He, She, It, singular or proper name” then auxiliary verb “has” is used after subject in sentence.<br>
		If subject is “You, They or plural” then auxiliary verb “have” is used after subject in sentence.<br><br>

		Examples<br>
			   I have eaten meal<br>
			   She has learnt a lesson<br><br>
		 
		Negative Sentence<br>
				• Subject + Auxiliary verb + NOT + main verb (past participle) + Subject<br>
				• Subject + has/have + NOT + 3rd form of verb or past participle + subject<br>
		Rules for using auxiliary verb “has or have” in negative sentence are same as mentioned above.<br><br>

		Examples<br>
			  I have not eaten meal.<br>
			  She has not learnt a lesson.<br><br>
		 
		Interrogative Sentences<br>
				 • Auxiliary verb + Subject + main verb (past participle) + Subject<br>
				 • Has/have + Subject + 3rd form of verb or past participle + subject<br>
		Interrogative sentence starts with auxiliary verb. If the subject is “He, She, It, singular or proper name” then
		the sentence starts with auxiliary verb “has”.<br>
		If subject is “You, They or plural” then the sentence starts with auxiliary verb “have”.<br><br>

		Examples<br>
			  Have I eaten meal?<br>
			  Has she learnt a lesson?<br>
	</p>	
	<h2>Present Perfect Continuous</h2>
	<p>
		It is used to express a continued or ongoing action that started in past and is continued until now. There will be a
		time reference, such as “since 1980, for three hours etc” from which the action has been started. A sense of time 
		reference is found in these sentences which gives an idea that action has been continued from some time in past till now.
		Such time reference or sense of time reference is the identity of Present perfect continuous tense because it tells that
		action has started from a particular time in past. For example, “He has been reading in this school since 2005”, so the 
		it means that he has started his education in this school in 2005 and he is studying in this school till now.<br><br>
		 
		Note: If there is not time reference or sense of time reference then it is not Present perfect continuous tense because 
		there is no hint about the time of action when it started in past and it seems just an ongoing action at present time 
		which resembles “present Continuous tense. So the reference of time differentiates between Present perfect continuous
		tense and Present continuous tense.<br><br>
		 
		Rules: An auxiliary verb “has been or have been” is used in sentence. 1st form of verb (base verb) +ing 
		(present participle) is used as main verb in sentence. “Since” or “for” is used before the “time reference”
		in sentence. If the time reference is exactly known such as 1995, 4 O’clock then “since” is used before the 
		time in sentence. If the time reference is not exactly known such as three hours, six years, four days, then 
		“for” is used before the time in sentence. Time reference such as 3 hours or 5 days is not exactly known because
		we don’t know that about which three hours a day is told in sentence or about which 5 days in a month is told in 
		sentence. While the 1995 is exactly known time.<br><br>
		 
										  Structure of sentence.<br><br>
		Positive Sentence.<br>
		• Subject + Auxiliary verb + main verb (Present participle) + Object + Time reference<br>
		• Subject + has been/have been + (1st form of verb or base verb + ing) + object +    time reference<br>

		If the subject is “He, She, It, singular or proper name” then auxiliary verb “has been” is used after subject in sentence.<br>
		If subject is “You, They or plural” then auxiliary verb “have been” is used after subject in sentence.<br><br>

		Examples.<br>
				He has been watering the plants for two hours.<br>
				I have been studying since 3 O’clock<br><br>
		 
		Negative Sentence.<br><br>
		• Subject +”Not” between the Auxiliary verb + main verb (present participle) +     Object + Time reference<br>

		• Subject + has not been/have not been + (1st form of verb or base verb + ing) +    object + time reference<br>

		To make negative sentence, the word “not” is written between the auxiliary verbs, so it becomes like “has not been or have
		notbeen”. The rule for using auxiliary verb “has been or have been” in negative sentences is as same as mentioned above.<br><br>

		Examples.<br>
				He has not been watering the plants for two hours.<br>
				I have not been studying since 3 O’clock.<br><br>
		 
		Interrogative Sentence.<br>
		• Auxiliary verb + Subject + Auxiliary verb + main verb (present participle) + object +    time reference<br>

		• Has/have + Subject + been + (1st form of verb or base verb+ing) + object + time    reference<br>
		Interrogative sentence starts with auxiliary verb. If the subject is “He, She, It, singular or proper name” then the
		sentence starts with auxiliary verb “has” and auxiliary verb “been” is used after subject<br>
		If subject is “You, They or plural” then the sentence starts with auxiliary verb “have” and “been” is used after subject<br><br>

		Examples.<br>
			  Has he been watering the plants for two hours?<br>
			  Have I been studying since 3 O’clock?<br>
