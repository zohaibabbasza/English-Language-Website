	<h2>Future Perfect Continuous</h2>
	<p>
		It is used to express a continued or ongoing action that will start in future and is thought to be continued till
		sometime in future. (Remember, an ongoing action in future which will continue till some time in future). There 
		will be a time reference, such as “since 1980, for three hours” from which the action will start in future and 
		will continue. A sense of time reference is found which gives an idea that action will start at some time in future
		and will continue for some time.  Such time reference or sense of time reference is the identity of Future perfect 
		continuous tense because it tells that action will start at a particular time in future. For example, “He will have 
		been studying in this school since 2005”, so the it means that he will start studying in this school in 2005 and will 
		study in this school till sometime in future.<br><br>

		Note: If there is not time reference or sense of time reference then it is not future perfect continuous tense because
		there is no hint about the time of action when it will start in future and it seems just an ongoing action in future 
		which resembles “future Continuous tense. So the reference of time differentiates between Future perfect continuous 
		tense between future continuous tense.<br><br>
		 
		Rules: An auxiliary verb “will have been” is used in sentence. 1st form of verb (base verb) +ing (present participle)
		is used as main verb in sentence. “Since” or “for” is used before the “time reference” in sentence. If the time 
		reference is exactly known such as 1995, 4 O’clock then “since” is used before the time in sentence. If the time 
		reference is not exactly known such as three hours, six years, four days, then “for” is used before the time in 
		sentence. Time reference such as 3 hours or 5 days is not exactly known because we don’t know that about which 
		three hours a day is told in sentence or about which 5 days in a month is told in sentence. While the 1995 is 
		exactly know time.<br><br>
		 
										 Structure of sentence.<br><br>
		Positive Sentence.<br>
		• Subject + Auxiliary verb + main verb (Present participle) + Object + Time reference<br>
		•Subject + will have been + (1st form of verb or base verb + ing) + object + time reference<br><br>

		Examples.<br>
				 I will have been waiting for him for one hour.<br>
				 She will have been playing football since 2015.<br><br>
		 
		Negative Sentence.<br>
		• Subject +”Not” inside Auxiliary verbs + main verb (present participle) + Object +    Time reference<br>
		• Subject + will not have been + (1st form of verb or base verb + ing) + object +    Time reference<br>
		To make negative sentence, the word “not” is added inside auxiliary verb, so it becomes “will not have been”.<br><br>

		Examples.<br>
				 I will not have been waiting for him for one hour.<br>
				 She will not have been playing football since 2015.<br><br>
		 
		Interrogative Sentence.<br>
		• Auxiliary verb + Subject + auxiliary verb + main verb (present participle) + object +    time reference<br>

		• Will + Subject + have been + (1st form of verb or base verb+ing) + object + time    reference<br>
		Interrogative sentence starts with auxiliary verb “will” and auxiliary verb “have been” is used after subject in sentence.<br><br>

		Examples.<br>
				Will I have been waiting for him for one hour?<br>
				Will she have been playing football since 2015?<br>
