	<center><h1>Past Tense</h1></center>
	<h2>Simple Past</h2>
	<p>
		It is used to express an action that happened or completed in past, usually a very little time before speaking, or
		action which is just completed. Time of action is not specified in terms of long time ago or short ago but it make 
		a sense that the action has done a little time ago. For example, a person says, “I watched a movie”, it means the 
		speaker of this sentence watched a movie a little time ago or little time ago in the same day. <br><br>

		Rules:2nd form of verb (past simple) is used as main verb in the positive sentences and base form is used in negative
		and interrogative sentences.<br><br>
		 
										Structure of sentences <br><br>
		Positive Sentence<br>
			  • Subject + main verb (past simple) + object<br>
			  • Subject + 2nd form of verb (past simple) + object<br><br>

		Examples<br>
			  I killed a snake<br>
			  He ate a mango.<br><br>
			  
		Negative sentences<br>
			   • Subject + (auxiliary verb + not) main verb (base form) + object<br>
			   • Subject + did not + 1st form of verb or base form + object<br><br>

		In negative sentence “did not” is written and the 1st form of verb (base verb) is used instead of using 2nd form 
		(or past simple verb).<br><br>

		Examples.<br>
			   I did not kill a snake<br>
			   He did not eat a mango<br><br>
			   
		Interrogative sentences<br>
			 • Auxiliary verb + subject + main verb (base verb) + object<br>
			 • Did + subject + 1st form of verb (or base verb) + object<br><br>

		Interrogative sentence starts with “did” and the 1st form of verb (base verb) is used instead of using 2nd form 
		(or past simple verb).<br><br>

		Examples<br>
			 Did I kill a snake?<br>
			 Did he eat a mango?<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Past Continuous</h2>
	<p>
		It is used to express a continued or ongoing action in past, an ongoing action which occurred in past and completed at 
		some point in past. It expresses an ongoing nature of an action in past.  For example, “he was laughing.” This sentence
		shows ongoing action (laughing) of a person which occurred in past. Past continuous tense is also called past 
		progressive.  <br><br>
		 
		Rules: Auxiliary verb “was or were” is used in sentence. 1st form of verb or base verb + ing (present participle) is
		used as main verb in sentence.<br><br>
		 
										Structure of sentence<br><br>
		Positive sentences<br>
				  • Subject + auxiliary verb + Main Verb (present participle) + object<br>
				  • Subject + was/were + (1st form of verb or base verb +ing) +object<br><br>

		If the subject is “he, she, It, I, singular or proper noun” then auxiliary verb “was” is used. If subject is “you, we,
		they or plural” then auxiliary verb “were” is used.<br>
		Examples.<br>
					  She was crying yesterday.<br>
					  They were climbing on a hill.<br><br>
					  
		Negative sentences<br>
				 • Subject + auxiliary verb + NOT + Main verb (present participle) + object<br>
				 • Subject + was/were + NOT + (1st form of verb or base verb +ing) +object<br><br>

		Rules for using auxiliary verb after subject are same as mentioned above.<br><br>
		Examples.<br>
					 She was not crying yesterday.<br>
					 They were not climbing on a hill.<br><br>
		
		Interrogative sentences<br>
				 • Auxiliary verb + Subject + Main verb (present participle) + object<br>
				 • Was/were + Subject + (1st form of verb or base verb +ing) +object<br><br>

		The interrogative sentence starts with the auxiliary verb. If the subject is “he, she, It, I, singular or proper noun” 
		then the sentence starts with auxiliary verb “was”. If subject is “you, we, they or plural” then the sentence starts with
		auxiliary verb “were”.<br><br>
		Examples.<br>
					 Was she crying yesterday?<br>
					 Were they climbing on a hill?<br>
	</p>	
	<h2>Past Perfect</h2>
	<p>
		It is used to express an action which has occurred in past (usually, a long time ago) and action which has occurred 
		in past before another action in past. <br><br>
		 
		For example,<br>
		I had lived in America. (The sense of time in this sentence refers to a completed action in past and especially a 
		long time ago)<br>
		 
		The students had gone before the teacher came.  (The first part of sentence “The student has gone” is sentence of 
		past perfect tense, it says about an action which occurred before another action in past which is “the teacher came”.
		The second part “the teacher came” is sentence of past simple tense. So such a sentence which express an action in past
		before another action in past comprises two parts where the first part of sentence is past perfect tense) <br><br>
		 
		Rules. Auxiliary verb “had” is used in sentence. 3rd form of verb (past participle) is used as main verb in sentence<br><br>
		 
									 Structure of sentence.<br><br>
		Positive sentence<br>
				• Subject + auxiliary verb + main verb (past participle) + object<br>
				• Subject + had + 3rd form of verb or past participle + object<br><br>

		Examples.<br>
			  He had taken the exam last year<br>
			  A thief had stolen my watch.<br><br>
			  
		Negative sentence<br>
				• Subject + auxiliary verb + NOT + main verb (past participle) + object<br>
				•Subject + had + not + 3rd form of verb or past participle + object<br><br>

		   “Not” is written after auxiliary verb in negative sentence.<br><br>
		Examples.<br>
			   He had not taken the exam last year<br>
			   A thief had not stolen my watch.<br><br>
			   
		Interrogative sentence<br>
			   • Auxiliary verb + subject + main verb (past participle) + object<br>
			   • Had + subject + 3rd form of verb or past participle + object<br><br>

			 Interrogative sentence starts with auxiliary verb “had”<br><br>
		Examples.<br>
			  Had he taken the exam last year<br>
			  Had a thief stolen my watch?<br>
	</p>	
	<h2>Past Perfect Continuous</h2>
	<p>
		It is used to express a continued or ongoing action that started in past and continued until sometime in past. (Remember, 
		an ongoing action in past which continued till some time in past) There will be a time reference, such as “since 1980, 
		for three hours etc” from which the action had started. A sense of time reference is found in these sentences which shows
		that action had started in past and continued till some time in past.  Such time reference or sense of reference is the 
		identity of Present perfect continuous tense because it tells that action has started from a particular time in past or
		for some time period. For example, “He had been studying in this school since 2005”, so the it means that he had started
		his education in this school in 2005 and he studied in this school till sometime in past.<br><br>

		Note: If there is not time reference or sense of time reference, then it is not Past perfect continuous tense because
		there is no hint about the time of action when it started in past or continued for some time period, so it seems just
		an ongoing action in past which resembles “past Continuous tense”. So the reference of time differentiates between Past
		perfect continuous tense and past continuous tense.<br><br>
		 
		Rules: An auxiliary verb “had been” is used in sentence. 1st form of verb (base verb) +ing (present participle)
		is used as main verb in sentence. “Since” or “for” is used before the “time reference” in sentence. If the time
		reference is exactly known such as 1995, 4 O’clock then “since” is used before the time in sentence. If the time 
		reference is not exactly known such as three hours, six years, four days, then “for” is used before the time in 
		sentence. Time reference such as 3 hours or 5 days is not exactly known because we don’t know that about which three
		hours a day is told in sentence or about which 5 days in a month is told in sentence. While the 1995 is exactly known
		time.<br><br>
		 
										   Structure of sentence.<br><br>
		Positive Sentence.<br>
		• Subject + Auxiliary verb + main verb (Present participle) + Object + Time reference<br>
		• Subject + had been + (1st form of verb or base verb + ing) + object + time    reference<br><br>

		Examples.<br>
			  I had been waiting for him for one hour.<br>
			  She had been playing chess since 7 O’clock.<br><br>
		 
		Negative Sentence.<br>
		• Subject +”Not” between the Auxiliary verbs + main verb (present participle) +     Object + Time reference<br>
		• Subject + had not been + (1st form of verb or base verb + ing) + object + time    reference<br>
		To make negative sentence, the word “not” is added inside auxiliary verb, so it becomes “had not been”.<br><br>
		Examples.<br>
				I had not been waiting for him for one hour.<br>
				She had not been playing chess since 7 O’clock.<br><br>
		 
		Interrogative Sentence.<br>
		• Auxiliary verb+ Subject + Auxiliary verb + main verb (present participle) + object +    time reference<br>
		• Had + Subject +  been + (1st form of verb or base verb+ing) + object + time    reference<br>

		Interrogative sentence starts with auxiliary verb “had” and auxiliary verb “been” is used after subject in sentence.<br><br>
		Examples.<br>
				Had I been waiting for him for one hour?<br>
				Had she been playing chess 7 O’clock?<br>
